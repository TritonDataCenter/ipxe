iPXE README File (as adapted to illumos systems)

To build:

    gmake install

ipxe, unlike virtually all other software, actually assumes and requires
GNU ld to build.  This is because of the presence of GNU linker scripts.
These could be converted to ld, but there's little need; since this does
not generate anything that actually runs under illumos, the GNU linker's
deficiencies aren't especially important.

If your system is not SmartOS, or is older than 20121213, your 'awk' is
most likely 'oawk', which will hang on a construct used by the
makefiles.  Use nawk or gawk instead.

The build system uses grep -E, supported by the XPG4 grep but not the
Sun one.  You can also use GNU grep if necessary.

You will need gcc and GNU binutils installed from pkgsrc or some similar
repository of packages, or to have built your own.  Version requirements
are very broad and almost anything should suffice.

You may need to obtain and install syslinux, which does build on illumos
systems.  This utility is used by util/genliso and util/gensdsk.  You
will need to determine whether your use case requires these utilities.
